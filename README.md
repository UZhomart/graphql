## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Git (for cloning the repository)
- Local web server (for development)

### Local Development

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/uzhomart/graphql.git
   cd graphql
   ```

2. **Start a local server**

   **Option 1: Using Python (Recommended)**

   ```bash
   # macOS/Linux
   python3 -m http.server 8000

   # Windows
   python -m http.server 8000

   # If python3 not found on macOS, install: brew install python3
   ```

   **Option 2: Using Node.js**

   ```bash
   # Install serve globally (one time)
   npm install -g serve

   # Start server
   npx serve .
   # or
   serve .
   ```

   **Option 3: Using PHP**

   ```bash
   # macOS/Linux
   php -S localhost:8000

   # Windows
   php -S localhost:8000
   ```

   **Option 4: Using VS Code Live Server Extension**

   1. Install "Live Server" extension in VS Code
   2. Right-click on `index.html`
   3. Select "Open with Live Server"
   4. Automatically opens in browser with auto-reload

   **Option 5: Using Python Simple Server**

   ```bash
   # macOS/Linux (Python 2)
   python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000

   # Windows (Python 2)
   python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
   ```

3. **Open in browser**

   ```bash
   http://localhost:8000
   ```

4. **Troubleshooting**

   - **"python: command not found"** (macOS): Use `python3` instead of `python`
   - **Permission denied**: Try port 3000 or 8080 instead
   - **CORS errors**: Use a proper HTTP server (not file:// protocol)
   - **Port already in use**: Change port number (e.g., 8001, 3000)
